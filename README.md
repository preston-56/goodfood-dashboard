# React Typescript Dashboard Documentation

### Overview

This Dashboard is a web application built using React+Vite and TypeScript. It serves as a management tool for a food delivery service called "GoodFood". The dashboard provides various features and visualizations to monitor and manage different aspects of the service, such as revenue, order trends, customer reviews, and most ordered food items.

However, it is not fully functional[dynamic] as such since it is an attempt to interpret a mockup figma [template](https://www.figma.com/proto/L8NQuywp3MA2YUKrGXsmR4/Dashboard-(Community)?node-id=0-61) and represent it in the frontend. It is not an exact copy of the template, but in all respects it answers to most of the features that define the template. It is also **NOT RESPONSIVE** especially on mobile devices.

### Project Structure

This is a basic hierarchy structure that captures the project's key features and makes it effortless to navigate through its components.
